# PokemonMap
Pokemon React Native project that is simillar of Pokemon Go where you can interact with Pokemon on the map(uses location services to know where you are) 
and see all the information you can about that pokemon. It isn't a game however, it is more for information and the ability to pick your own pokemon, unlike Pokemon Go. You can pick your favorite Pokemon, and add and remove these Pokemon.
